Enlist few of the repetitively ask java related to questions with the solutions 
Inheritances 
Polymorphism
Abstraction
Encapsulation

Inheritances : 
One class want to access the features of other class this can be done by inheritances .
Def: Object of one class acquire property of object of another class.
  Class A
{
  Void f1()
{
System.out.println(“Hello Word”);
}

}
Class B extends A
{


Void f2()
{
System.out.println(“I am inner class”);
}
}

Here Class B can extends the function which is defined by class A( base class) . so class B can access f1() method directly.
main()
{
 B obj1=new B();
obj1.f1(); 
 	// it will call the base class methods (code reusability done here no need to write same methods
}
--------------------------------------------
Advantages of Inheritances :
Code reusability is done by inheritances.
We can add additional features to an existing class without modifying  it.
